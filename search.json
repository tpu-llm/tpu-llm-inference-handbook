    "text": "TPU LLM Inference - Part 1: The foundations\nLet’s start our journey with a simple, hands-on experiment. Before we dive into the complexities of the Large Language Model (LLM) and specialized accelerator hardware, let’s run a single piece of Python code. This script performs one of the most fundamental operations in computing: multiplying two matrices together.\nSave the following code as matrix_heartbeat_cpu.py on your local computer and run it from your terminal. You will need to have PyTorch installed (pip install torch).\nWhen you run this (python3 matrix_heartbeat_cpu.py), observe how long it takes to complete the task. It might take a few seconds. This simple calculation, this single computational “heartbeat,” is the key to understanding the immense power and challenge of running modern artificial intelligence.\nThis guide is the first in a series dedicated to harnessing the power of Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for inference. We will build our understanding from the ground up, moving from architectural theory to practical, hands-on application.",

    "text": "From Simple Math to Complex AI: The Transformer’s Core\nThe script you just ran performed a single matrix multiplication. It may seem basic, but this exact mathematical operation, scaled up thousands of times and chained together in intricate layers, is the fundamental building block of the Transformer architecture. This architecture is the engine behind virtually all state-of-the-art LLMs.\nWhen an LLM generates text, it’s not “thinking” in a human sense. It is, at its core, executing a staggering number of matrix and vector computations. These operations occur in two key parts of every Transformer layer:\n\nSelf-Attention: This is the mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input text. To do this, it transforms the input data into three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The core of the attention calculation is a massive matrix multiplication of Q and K.\n\nFeed-Forward Networks: After the attention mechanism, the data passes through a standard neural network layer, which again is fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications followed by non-linear activation functions.\n\nAn LLM with billions of parameters is, in essence, a vast collection of these matrix operations. Running inference—the process of generating a response from a trained model—requires executing these calculations as quickly and efficiently as possible. Your CPU can handle one multiplication, but to serve a real-world application, we need hardware specifically designed for this task.",

    "text": "The Rhythmic Heart of AI: Why TPUs Excel at LLM Inference\nTo truly appreciate why a developer should invest time in learning TPUs, it is essential to move beyond the simple statement “it’s fast” and delve into the architectural elegance that makes this speed possible. The advantage of the TPU is not just an incremental improvement; it is a paradigm shift in processing designed specifically for the mathematics of machine learning.\nTraditional processors, including Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), are built upon the von Neumann architecture. This model involves a processing unit that fetches instructions and data from a separate memory unit, performs a computation, and writes the result back to memory. An effective analogy is a chef (the processor) who must constantly run to a pantry (memory) to retrieve one ingredient at a time for each step of a recipe. This constant back-and-forth travel creates a significant performance limitation known as the “von Neumann bottleneck”. While GPUs dramatically increase performance by employing thousands of chefs working in parallel, they all still run to the same pantry, meaning memory access remains a fundamental constraint.\nThe Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) was designed to solve this very problem for machine learning workloads. At its core is a component called the Matrix Multiply Unit (MXU), which contains a systolic array. This architecture represents a complete departure from the fetch-and-execute model. The term “systolic” is an analogy to the human circulatory system, where the heart pumps blood in a steady, rhythmic pulse. Similarly, in a TPU, data is not fetched from memory for each individual calculation. Instead, it is pumped rhythmically through a large, two-dimensional grid of simple processors.\nEach cell in the systolic array performs a simple multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation on the data it receives from an upstream neighbor, and then passes the partial result to its downstream neighbor in perfect time with a system clock. Weights are pre-loaded into the array, and input data flows through it in a wave. The final results of a massive matrix multiplication emerge from the array over time, with minimal need for the processors to access main memory during the computation itself. This “data-in-motion” paradigm effectively designs the memory bottleneck out of the most intensive part of the neural network calculation.\nUltimately, these architectural advantages translate into a critical business metric: price-performance. For large-scale inference, faster computation means fewer accelerators are needed to serve the same number of users, which directly lowers operational costs. For any large and complex LLM, this efficiency is not a minor optimization; it is what makes serving it economically viable at scale. This proven cost-efficiency, rooted in the TPU’s long history of powering massive internal Google services like Search, Photos, and Translate, establishes it as a premier platform for deploying the next generation of machine learning models.",

    "text": "TPU inference stack\nRunning large language models efficiently requires a full “stack” of technology where each layer is optimized to work with the one above it, as shown in the diagram below.\n![][image1]\nThe foundation is the TPU designed specifically for the massive matrix calculations at the heart of AI. This powerful compute is connected by ultra-fast networking and paired with a flexible storage system. On top of this hardware runs the open software layer. This includes essential tools like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Compute Engine to manage the infrastructure, popular ML frameworks like JAX and PyTorch to build models, and the critical XLA compiler that translates framework code into highly efficient instructions for the TPUs.\nThis integrated hardware and software environment is the perfect platform for running today’s most advanced Large Language Models, from Google’s Gemma to open models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek. The final piece of the stack is the Inference Engine, such as JetStream or vLLm. This top-level software acts as a smart conductor, taking a trained model and serving it for real-world applications. It handles incoming user requests, manages memory, and optimizes the model’s execution to ensure maximum speed and throughput. Every layer in this stack works in harmony to make demanding AI inference fast, scalable, and efficient.\nFor the purposes of this introductory guide, we will use the Cloud TPU VM to get a taste of TPU.",

Using the -f flag to point to the Google Storage release index is crucial for getting the correct, compatible versions.\nBash\n(vm)$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev -y\n(vm)$ pip install numpy\n\n(vm)$ pip install torch torch_xla[tpu] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html\n\n\nListening to the Heartbeat: CPU vs. TPU Showdown\nNow, we will run a slightly modified version of our original script. This version adds the necessary torch_xla code to ensure the computation runs on the TPU hardware.\nCreate a file named matrix_heartbeat_tpu.py on the VM and paste the following code:\nRun the script from the VM’s terminal:\nBash\n(vm)$ python3 matrix_heartbeat_tpu.py\nThe expected output should look similar to this:\nThe key indicator of success is seeing the device listed as xla:0 (or another number). This confirms that the tensors were created on the TPU and the computation was executed there.\nNow, compare the TPU execution time to the time you recorded from your local CPU. You should see a dramatic difference—what took seconds on a general-purpose CPU is completed in a fraction of a second on hardware purpose-built for this exact task.
